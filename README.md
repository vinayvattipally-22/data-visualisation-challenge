### Pymaceuticals Inc.
## Analysis
 This repository contains Python code for analyzing pharmaceutical data related to drug regimens, mouse experiments, and tumor volume. The code uses the Pandas library to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

## Prerequisites
 Before running the provided Python code for the Pymaceuticals Inc. pharmaceutical data analysis, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

 # Python:
 Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.


 ## Python Libraries:

 # Pandas:
  This code heavily relies on the Pandas library for data manipulation. You can install it using pip:
 . pip install pandas

 # Matplotlib:
  Matplotlib is used for creating various data visualizations. You can install it with:
  .pip install matplotlib
 # Scipy:
  The scipy.stats module is used for statistical analysis. You can install it using:
  . pip install scipy

 # Data Files:

  The code assumes that you have two data files, "Mouse_metadata.csv" and "Study_results.csv," in a directory named "data." You should adjust the file paths in the code to match your directory structure if needed.

 # Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
  While you can run the code in a standard Python environment, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Jupyter Notebook can enhance your experience. You can install Jupyter Notebook via:
  . pip install notebook

 # Data Understanding:
  To interpret the results of the analysis effectively, it's essential to have a basic understanding of pharmaceutical data, including concepts like drug regimens, mouse metadata, tumor volume, and timepoints.

 # Statistical Knowledge:
  Some parts of the code involve statistical analysis and terminology. Familiarity with statistical concepts such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, correlation, and linear regression is beneficial.

 With these prerequisites in place, you'll be well-prepared to run the provided Python code and gain insights into the pharmaceutical data analyzed by Pymaceuticals Inc. Make sure to adjust the code as needed to match your data file paths and environment configuration.


## Dependencies and Setup
 Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

 . matplotlib.pyplot for creating plots.
 . pandas for data manipulation.
 . scipy.stats for statistical analysis and linear regression.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
 The code begins with data cleaning, removing duplicate records and null values to create a clean and reliable dataset. The dataset combines information from two data sources: Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv.

## Summary Statistics
 The code calculates and presents summary statistics for tumor volume, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean (SEM) for each drug regimen. This provides a comprehensive overview of how different regimens affect tumor volume in mice.

## Visualization
  The analysis includes multiple visualization methods to present the data in an easily understandable format:

 # Bar Plots:
  Both Pandas and Pyplot are used to create bar plots to visualize the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen. These visualizations help in comparing the number of observations for different treatments.

 # Pie Charts:
  Similar to bar plots, both Pandas and Pyplot are utilized to display the distribution of female versus male mice. These pie charts provide a clear breakdown of the gender distribution within the mouse population.

 # Box Plots:
  Box plots are generated to visualize the distribution of tumor volume for specific treatment regimens. The box plots highlight potential outliers and the spread of data.

 # Line Plot:
  A line plot is used to illustrate how tumor volume changes over time for a single mouse treated with Capomulin. This provides insight into the effectiveness of the drug regimen for that particular mouse.

 # Scatter Plot:
  A scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between mouse weight and the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen. This analysis helps assess the potential correlation between weight and tumor volume.

## Outliers and Potential Data Anomalies
 The code identifies and discusses potential outliers in the data. Outliers, particularly in the context of tumor volume, can be critical in understanding the effectiveness of drug regimens.

## Correlation and Regression Analysis
 A correlation analysis is performed to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. Additionally, a linear regression model is applied to provide predictive insights into the relationship between these variables.

## COnclusion:
 In summary, the Python code for Pymaceuticals Inc.'s pharmaceutical data analysis equips researchers and analysts with the tools to comprehensively evaluate the impact of drug regimens on tumor volume and to understand potential correlations between mouse weight and tumor volume. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for data-driven decision-making in the field of pharmaceutical research, offering a deeper understanding of treatment outcomes and data patterns.
